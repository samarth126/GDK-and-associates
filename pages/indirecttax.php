         <p>The Indirect tax system in India has experienced a major change in July 2017 with introducing GST, replacing the previous systems of excise, VAT, Service Tax, etc. The new regime aims at better transparency and fairness among goods and service providers, and it also introduces significantly more and better compliance requirements as different returns every month,
          multiple tax payments every month, and reconciliation of tax credits claimed by entities.</p>

<p>GDK & Associates has successfully helped all of its clients in converting them into the new system and cooperate with them periodically in meeting the legal requirements of GST. We at GDK provide the following indirect tax services to our clients:</p>
